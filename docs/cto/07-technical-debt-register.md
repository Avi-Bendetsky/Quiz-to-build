## 4. Detailed Debt Item Documentation

### 4.1 TD-010: Monolithic API Structure

**Created:** {{DATE}}  
**Last Updated:** {{DATE}}  
**Owner:** {{LEAD_DEV}}  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Design Debt

#### Description
The initial API was built as a single NestJS application handling all domains (questionnaire, documents, users, admin). This was appropriate for MVP but now limits:
- Independent scaling of high-traffic services
- Independent deployment cycles
- Team autonomy and parallel development

#### Root Cause
Time-to-market pressure during initial development. Decision made consciously to reduce complexity.

#### Impact
- Document generation cannot scale independently during peak usage
- Any deployment affects all services
- Longer build and test times
- Harder to assign clear ownership

#### Remediation Plan
1. **Phase 1:** Define service boundaries (already documented in architecture)
2. **Phase 2:** Extract Document Generation Service (highest value)
3. **Phase 3:** Extract User Management Service
4. **Phase 4:** Extract Question Engine Service
5. **Phase 5:** Implement service mesh for communication

#### Effort Estimate
- Phase 1: 1 week (completed)
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 3 weeks
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- **Total:** ~11 weeks of engineering effort

#### Risks if Not Addressed
- Performance bottlenecks during growth
- Deployment failures affecting entire system
- Developer productivity decrease

### 4.2 TD-012: Missing Integration Tests

**Created:** {{DATE}}  
**Last Updated:** {{DATE}}  
**Owner:** {{QA_LEAD}}  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Testing Debt

#### Description
Current integration test coverage is approximately 40% on API endpoints. Critical paths like questionnaire submission and document generation have coverage, but edge cases and error scenarios are under-tested.

#### Current State
| Module | Coverage | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Authentication | 75% | 90% |
| Questionnaire | 60% | 90% |
| Documents | 45% | 90% |
| Admin | 20% | 80% |
| User Management | 35% | 85% |

#### Root Cause
- Rapid feature development prioritized over testing
- No integration testing requirement in PR checklist until recently
- Complex test setup for document generation

#### Impact
- Higher risk of regression bugs
- Slower code reviews (manual verification needed)
- Reduced confidence in refactoring
- Longer bug investigation times

#### Remediation Plan
1. Set up integration test infrastructure improvements (Docker compose for test DB)
2. Create test data factories for common entities
3. Sprint-by-sprint coverage targets:
   - Sprint 1: Authentication to 90%
   - Sprint 2: Questionnaire to 90%
   - Sprint 3: Documents to 90%
   - Sprint 4: Admin and User Management

#### Effort Estimate
- Infrastructure: 1 week
- Factories: 3 days
- Test writing: 4 weeks
- **Total:** ~5 weeks

### 4.3 TD-013: Legacy PDF Library

**Created:** {{DATE}}  
**Last Updated:** {{DATE}}  
**Owner:** {{DEV_2}}  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Infrastructure Debt

#### Description
The current PDF generation library (`pdfkit` v0.12) has known memory leaks when generating documents over 50 pages. Business plans can exceed 60 pages with appendices.

#### Symptoms
- Memory usage spikes during batch document generation
- Occasional container OOM kills in production
- Slow garbage collection affecting response times

#### Root Cause
Library version has known issue (#4521 in their GitHub). Workaround applied but not fully effective.

#### Impact
- System instability during high document generation periods
- Increased infrastructure costs (larger containers needed)
- User experience impact (timeouts)

#### Remediation Options

| Option | Pros | Cons | Effort |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Upgrade pdfkit | Minimal code changes | May have breaking changes | 1 week |
| Switch to Puppeteer/Playwright | Better HTML rendering | Higher memory baseline | 2 weeks |
| External PDF service | Offload completely | Vendor dependency, cost | 1 week |

**Recommended:** Switch to Puppeteer with proper pooling

#### Remediation Plan
1. Spike: Test Puppeteer with current templates (2 days)
2. Convert templates to HTML/CSS (1 week)
3. Implement Puppeteer service with browser pooling (3 days)
4. Parallel testing with existing system (1 week)
5. Migration and deprecation of old system (2 days)
