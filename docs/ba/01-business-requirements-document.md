## 2. Executive Summary

### 2.1 Purpose
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) defines the high-level business requirements, objectives, and scope for the Adaptive Client Questionnaire System. This system will enable non-technical entrepreneurs to generate comprehensive business documentation through an intelligent, adaptive questionnaire experience.

### 2.2 Project Background
Entrepreneurs launching new businesses require comprehensive documentation across technical (CTO), financial (CFO), and operational (BA) domains. Currently, this process is:
- Time-consuming (60+ hours of manual work)
- Expensive (consulting fees of $5,000-$50,000)
- Inconsistent (varying quality and completeness)
- Inaccessible (requires specialized knowledge)

### 2.3 Business Opportunity
Create an automated platform that democratizes business documentation, making professional-quality plans accessible to all entrepreneurs regardless of technical or business expertise.
